## Depthboot vs mainline
(Mainline = stock, unmodified Linux distribution)

**Mainline Linux:**
* Requires either replacing firmware completely(UEFI) or changing a part of it(rw_legacy). Not all devices have both options and there is a slight risk of bricking the Chromebook
* Some hardware may not work(touchscreen, touchpad...)
* Audio is mostly unsupported

**Depthboot:**
* Requires no modifications to firmware
* Hardware works the same as in ChromeOS
* More audio support available
